## Usage

To use this CI/CD repo:

- clone it,
- change "<hudson.plugins.git.UserRemoteConfig> url" in seedJob.xml to your API repo url
- add Jenkins.file to your API repo and define your pipelines there, they will be executed by Container defined in this repo,
- build and run container that will execute your pipelines:

> ./gradlew build docker dockerRun

## How it works?

The createJobs.groovy files will be used by Jenkins job DSL plugin to create build/test job.

This repository uses Infrastructure as a Code philosophy, setting everything beforehand up.
